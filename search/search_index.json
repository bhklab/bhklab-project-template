If you want to contribute to the project template, please take the time to read the copier documentation on how projects are configured and how to use it. How projects are created from templates For the bhklab-project-template , the project is created not by using the copier command directly, but rather via the the python API that is exposed by the copier package. This is done to allow for more flexibility and customization of the project creation process. You can find the code that creates the project in the src/bhklab_project_template/__init__.py . We wrap the API in a click command line interface. I chose this route to make it super simple to get started and to remove the friction in the experience of creating a new project. Contributing to the project template The project template is made up of the following: the copier.yml which defines the questions to ask when creating a new project, and saves the answers to be used by copier to fill in the template files. the TEMPLATE directory which contains the files that will be copied to the new project. The files in this directory are templated using the Jinja2 templating engine and the answers provided in the copier.yml file. the src/bhklab_project_template directory which contains the code that implements the project template. the copier-settings.yml which is just an extension of the copier.yml file via the include feature of copier . This file defines some constant variables used in the workflow, and more importantly, it defines the copier tasks that are run after the project is created. Contributing damply and the DamplyDirs utility The DamplyDirs utility is provided via the damply package, and is already included in the project template's pixi.toml file If there are any issues or features that you would like to see in the damply package, please open an issue or a pull request in the bhklab/damply repository","title":"Development"},{"location":"development/#development-contribution-guide","text":"This project uses the copier tool .

This structure is designed to: Facilitate reproducible research Provide a clear organization for data, code, and documentation Support collaboration and data sharing Promote familiarity and ease of use across projects Understanding DMP Directories is mandatory in the BHKLab This page is just a brief overview of the DMP directory structure. For a comprehensive overview, please take the time to read and understand the damply documentation . The standardized DMP directory structure is implemented via the damply package, which provides tools and conventions for organizing project files in accordance with DMP guidelines. DMP reproducibility litmus test If you are unsure whether your project is DMP-reproducible, ask yourself the following questions: If I had no prior knowledge of the data used in this project, does the documentation provide enough information to understand the data, its sources, and how to obtain it? If I were a new collaborator, would I be able to understand the code and documentation I need to understand and reproduce the project? If I were to delete all the procdata and results directories, could I reproduce the results with just the rawdata and workflow content? DMP Directory Structure As of writing, the recommended directory structure is as follows: project_root/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config/ # Configuration files \u251c\u2500\u2500 data/ # All data in one parent directory \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 procdata/ # Processed/intermediate data \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 rawdata/ # Raw input data \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 results/ # Analysis outputs \u251c\u2500\u2500 logs/ # Log files \u251c\u2500\u2500 metadata/ # Dataset descriptions \u2514\u2500\u2500 workflow/ # Code organization \u251c\u2500\u2500 notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/ # Analysis scripts DamplyDirs Overview Assuming the above directory structure, the damply package provides a simple way to access these directories via the DamplyDirs class. This class takes advantage of the following environment variables that are defined in the template's pixi.toml file: [activation] # convenient variables which can be used in scripts env . CONFIG = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/config\" env . METADATA = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/metadata\" env . LOGS = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/logs\" env . RAWDATA = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/data/rawdata\" env . PROCDATA = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/data/procdata\" env . RESULTS = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/data/results\" env . SCRIPTS = \"${PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT}/workflow/scripts\" This allows you to programmatically access the directories in your project without hardcoding paths, making your code more portable and easier to maintain. Example Usage Here is an example of how to use the DamplyDirs class in your project: from damply import dirs fastq_file = dirs . RAWDATA / \"fastq\" / \"sample_1.fq.gz\" print ( f \"Processing FASTQ file: { fastq_file } \" ) # Processing FASTQ file: /home/bhkuser/proejcts/data/rawdata/fastq/sample_1.fq.gz A full comprehensive walkthrough of the DamplyDirs utility can be found in the damply documentation .","title":"DMP Directories"},{"location":"dmp_directories/#working-with-dmp-directories","text":"Over the years, we have developed a standardized directory structure via the data management plan (DMP) in our projects.

System Requirements Section Description 1. Git Version Requirements Git v2.28+ installation 2. Pixi Tool Requirements Pixi package manager setup 3. GitHub CLI Authentication GitHub CLI auth setup 1. Git Version Requirements You must have Git version 2.28 or higher installed on your system. This is because our template uses the --initial-branch option in the git init command. To check your Git version: git --version If your Git version is below 2.28, please update it following instructions for your operating system. 2. Pixi Tool Requirements Pixi is our preferred package manager and environment manager for this project. 2.1 Installing Pixi If you haven't installed Pixi yet: Visit the pixi documentation for installation instructions Follow the platform-specific instructions to install Pixi on your system 2.2 Verifying Installation After installation, run the following commands to verify that Pixi is properly installed: # Check pixi version pixi --version # Verify GitHub CLI is accessible through pixi pixi exec gh --help # Verify our project template tool is accessible pixi exec bhklab-project-template --help If any of these commands fail, please reinstall Pixi or make sure it's properly added to your PATH. 3. GitHub CLI Authentication Our template interacts with GitHub APIs through the GitHub CLI tool ( gh ), which requires authentication. 3.1 Logging into GitHub CLI Run the following command and follow the prompts to authenticate: pixi exec gh auth login --hostname 'github.com' --git-protocol https 3.2 Verifying Authentication To verify you're properly authenticated: pixi exec gh auth status This should show that you're logged in to GitHub. Organization Access Make sure you have been added to our lab organization(s) before proceeding with project creation! Without proper organization access, you won't be able to create repositories in our shared spaces. Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues setting up these requirements, please: Check the error messages for specific guidance Reach out to the lab's technical team if problems persist Our project template will automatically validate these requirements and provide helpful error messages if any prerequisites are not met.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"requirements/#project-requirements","text":"This document outlines the necessary prerequisites for using the BHKLab Project Template.","title":"Project Requirements"},{"location":"requirements/#system-requirements","text":"Section Description 1.
